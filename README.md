# Mattermost for OpenShift Origin 3

This is instant Mattermost application for OpenShift Origin 3.

The license applies to all files inside this repository, not Mattermost itself.

## Prerequisites

OpenShift Origin 3 up and running, including the capability to create a new project.

## Disclaimer

By now only a Docker build strategy based Mattermost application is provided,
this may not be usable on OpenShift Online 3.

## Installation

```
oc new-project mattermost
oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goern/mattermost-openshift/centos7/mattermost.yaml
```

You need to provision a PV:
```
# cat mattermost-pv.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  nfs:
    path: /srv/nfs/path
    server: nfs-server
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain

# oc create -f mattermost-pv.yaml
```

and a route:

`oc expose service/mattermost --hostname=mattermost.example.com`

If you want to deploy a MySQL database, you could either use the one provided
by OpenShift or use the file `db.yaml`.

## Usage

Point your browser at `mattermost.example.com`, the first user you create will
be an Administrator of Mattermost.
